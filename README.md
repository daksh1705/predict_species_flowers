# Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning model using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify iris flowers into species based on their features. It uses the popular Iris dataset from the `sklearn.datasets` library.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with 4 features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on these features.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
